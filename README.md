    This Pomodoro Timer allows users to start a timer for a set time of 25 minutes and save notes / to-do's in the inbuilt Task Tracker. You can add, remove and edit tasks at your ease and at the bottom is a live clock added for good measure to make sure you're keeping track of the time you spent throughout the day.
